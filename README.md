# KrakenSDR-Pantograph-Antenna-Array
Scissor-jack mechanism to automatically tune a linear antenna array!

### Acknowledgements
This project is a fork of CrankyLinuxUser's [Pantograph Antenna Array](https://gitlab.com/crankylinuxuser/pantograph-antenna-array). I'm modifying it to work with the KerberosSDR, which runs 5 antennas instead of the original 4 in CLU's design.
